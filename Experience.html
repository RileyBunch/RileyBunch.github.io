  <h2> Steger & Bizzell Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    At my current role as a water/wastewater utility EIT, I run sophisticated water resource modeling, Design water and wastewater lines, create cost estimates, investigate CIP projects, coordinate utility relocation projects with TxDOT, and prepare written technical reports and engineering studies.<br><br>
    Modeling System Requirements:<br>
Run scenario-based modeling to simulate proposed demands and required
improvements through both service requests and client demand projections.
Troubleshoot known issues causes via modeling current the systems operations.<br><br>

    Subdivision Approach Main Projects:<br> 
Design solutions to provide service to subdivisions, advertise the design to the
bidding process, and organize contract documents for the project.<br><br>
    
Project Feasibility and System Design:<br>
Perform system capacity and pressure studies to confirm if an existing water
system can accept new connections or recommend required improvements for
service. Perform preliminary design and pricing for any required improvements.
TxDOT Utility Relocation Projects, Aqua Water Supply Corporation:
Create plans that match TxDOT and client requirements to relocate infrastructure
to be out of conflict with proposed TxDOT work. This was done for long sections
of road and intersections with conflicting transmission mains. Tasks included
overall engineering layout and design.

<h2>Central Texas Reinforcement</h2>

<p><small>After returning from my study abroad experience, I went to work at Central Texas Reinforcement a company that primarily operated on high rise structures in downtown Austin, Texas. 

I learned how steel bars and cables work together to support a concrete structure. 

I physically attached the rebar and cables to concrete forms and operated specifically designed equipment. 

During my time here, I adapted and learned very quickly while shadowing experienced tradesman. 

I quickly took on more responsibility working more independently and increased overall efficiency. </small></p><br>



<h2>Study Abroad</h2>

<p><small>In the summer of 2019, I participated in a Texas Tech University hosted study abroad in Sevilla, Spain. 

During these several weeks I was constantly forced to step out of my comfort zone and solve problems in an unfamiliar environment, which helped develop my confidence. 

I faced adversity throughout the experience and adapted in my classes, travelling with and without others, and using my resources when things did not go according to plan. 

Here I developed my real-world critical thinking skills, while practicing my limited Spanish fluency. 

I took two courses in the limited amount of time provided, one contributing to my minor in Mathematics. 

I am extremely appreciative of this experience where I learned applicable skills. </small></p><br>



<h2>Largo Concrete</h2>

<p><small>I have worked at Largo Concrete in Austin for a total of nine months. 

While working as a carpenter, I constructed and maintained concrete forms for slabs, walls, and columns. I installed shoring that supported workers, unfinished concrete, and other materials. 

I worked at a combined three locations and during my experience, learned about different construction materials, and about the processes used to implement and construct engineering designs. </small></p><br>



<h2>Tango Flight</h2>

<p><small>In my senior year of high school, the engineering teacher Mr. Dan Weyant started a program called <a href="https://www.tangoflight.org/">Tango Flight</a>, only a select few were chosen to participate in the experimental class. 

This class was like no other high school class in the nation in the sense that, we would be building and flying an FAA approved two-seated airplane. 

In this project I quickly stepped up by leading a small group of students and was trusted with unique responsibilities. 

For example, when it came time to install the engine into the front of the <a href="https://www.vansaircraft.com/"> Van's Aircraft</a> I was trusted with solving a fitment problem.

It seemed impossible trying to configure the engine into the small engine bay, and I was trusted and instructed to modify the engine by removing material on a redundant engine mount for proper fitment. 

By the end of the year, I got to experience flight in the very project we had been working so diligently on; 

I felt a sense of accomplishment from collaborative teamwork. </small></p>

<h2>Organizations/Projects</h2>
    <p><small>This website is a repository that I have coded and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/RileyBunch/RileyBunch.github.io">Github</a>.
      I have created five unique web pages as seen in the menu in the top-right corner, I have learned and utilized HTML, CSS, and a very limited amount of JavaScript. 
      The purpose of this website is to expand the information found on my LinkedIn profile and my resume; and, to also show my competency and advanced understanding of technology.<br><br>

Recently, I have joined an organization called <a href="https://www.raider-trader.com/">Raider-Trader.com</a>. 

I have been interested in fundamental investing since a very young age, and this organization is an incredible opportunity to connect and collaborate other students about investments.<br><br>
